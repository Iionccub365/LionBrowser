# LionBrowser
This is just as it sounds, A web browser.
Well, an older browser way before the times of Windows 7.
I used the .net framework because it is really the easiest thing for me.
Easy to use the Visual Studio UI and the code.
I had millions of problems. Such as certain files not wanting to go in there making me use website builders.
Stuffs that should hopefully be added into my project is a 9 tab feature. (not just the 2 of today)
How to install.(Something to note is since it uses the .exe file it will be windows only for now)
Step one. Download the code.
Step two. Program files go into LionBrowser > bin > debug > LionBrowser 1.0.3.exe
I'd recomend that you make a shortcut for your browser using the program path.
Editing is only able to be done in the visual studio. If you wan't to edit DO NOT CLONE!
Download the file, make a new project or if wanting to just edit the one you have edit the Sln file.
